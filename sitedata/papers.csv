2658,"Machine Learning Meets a Particle Accelerator","Chris Tennant, Adam Carpenter, Tom Powers, Anna Solopova, Lasitha Vidyaratne, Khan Iftekharuddin","Particle accelerators are arguably the most complex scientific instruments ever built. Working as an accelerator physicist at a user-facility, the goal is to maximize scientific output per operating dollar. Given the enormous amount of data generated by accelerators and the increasing demands on system performance, we recognize the need to leverage machine learning (ML). This talk reports on a time-series classification project where I've been involved in the full life-cycle of the project - from data exploration through deployment. During the project we have utilized supervised learning (both conventional and deep methods) as well as unsupervised learning.

2663,"Balancing Rational and Other-Regarding Preferences in Cooperative-Competitive Environments","Dmitry Ivanov, Vladimir Egorov, Alexey Shpilman","Recent studies extensively explore the interplay between cooperative and competitive behaviour in mixed environments, where purely rational agents often struggle to achieve stable cooperation. A prevalent approach to induce cooperative behaviour is to assign additional rewards based on other agents' well-being. However, this approach suffers from the issues of multi-agent credit assignment and non-stationarity. These issues are efficiently alleviated in cooperative setting with such algorithms as QMIX and COMA. As an extension of these algorithms for mixed environments, we propose BAROCCO. Our algorithm is compatible with both Q-learning and Actor-Critic frameworks and is capable to balance individual and social incentives.","reinforcementLearning","1","https://storage.googleapis.com/eeml/695077538ec84a359a7401aa3eb9c60d","https://www.youtube.com/embed/R49-aIGukvA"
2669,"Interpreting word embeddings using a distribution agnostic approach employing Hellinger distance","Tamás Ficsor, Gábor Berend","Word embeddings can encode semantic and syntactic features and have achieved many recent successes in solving NLP tasks. Despite their successes, it is not trivial to directly extract lexical information out of them. In this paper, we propose a transformation of the embedding space to a more interpretable one using the Hellinger distance. We additionally suggest a distribution-agnostic approach using Kernel Density Estimation. Furthermore method is introduced to measure the interpretability of the word embeddings in a dimension independent manner.","nlp","1","https://storage.googleapis.com/eeml/5e61dc9560774f38a68026928031629f","https://www.youtube.com/embed/QHeZIoqJ5Qc"
2670,"Order Altering Language Constructions Promote Generalization to Unseen Instructions of Ordinary Order​","Vladislav Kurenkov, Bulat Maksudov, Adil Khan","We analyze the performance of general deep reinforcement learning algorithms on a task-oriented language grounding problem, where language input contains multiple tasks and the model has no prior linguistic knowledge. In this preliminary work, we particularly focus on the language input with constructions that alter the order of execution. Our results  show  that  the  introduction  of  such  constructions  in  the training language input consistently improves the generalization to a higher number of tasks up from 3% to 14% over the different variations of training algorithms.","reinforcementLearning","1","https://storage.googleapis.com/eeml/f22f7a8778be4169ac4a6f3ebbfb62f7","https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-eVLp13jvQ&feature=youtu.be"
2674,"Continual Lerning with Gated Incremental Memories fro sequential data processing","Andrea Cossu, Antonio Carta, Davide Bacciu","The ability to learn in dynamic, nonstationary environments without forgetting previous knowledge, also known as Continual Learning (CL), is a key enabler for scalable and trustworthy deployments of adaptive solutions. This work proposes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture for CL that is able to deal with drift in input distribution without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. We compare the performances of our enhanced architecture against EWC and RNNs on a set of standard CL benchmarks. Results show the superior performance of our architecture and highlight the need for special solutions designed to address CL in RNNs.","Continual Learning","1","https://storage.googleapis.com/eeml/7f89284545a642b99439b2ffff730d95","https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZ59IN4fufI"
2677,"A Robust FD&I Methodology for Solenoid Pumps based on Discriminative Features","Akpudo Ugochukwu Ejike and Jang-Wook Hur","The need for accurate condition monitoring of hydraulic components (solenoid pumps) has attracted extensive research studies on techniques for optimized fault detection and isolation (FD&I). Because Mechanical vibrational signals reflect operational conditions, effective and efficient FD&I techniques depend largely on the discriminative nature of extracted features for diagnosis. Our study focusses on a multi-domain feature extraction procedure, discriminative feature selection using the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm, and fault isolation by the Gaussian kernel support vector machine (SVM*). The performance was tested on five VSC63A5 solenoid pumps at various operating (fault) conditions with a test accuracy of 99.6%.
