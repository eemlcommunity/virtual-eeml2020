Working as an accelerator physicist at a user-facility, the goal is to maximize scientific output per operating dollar. Given the enormous amount of data generated by accelerators and the increasing demands on system performance, we recognize the need to leverage machine learning (ML).

2663,Balancing Rational and Other-Regarding Preferences in Cooperative-Competitive Environments,"Dmitry Ivanov, Vladimir Egorov, Alexey Shpilman","Recent studies extensively explore the interplay between cooperative and competitive behaviour in mixed environments, where purely rational agents often struggle to achieve stable cooperation. A prevalent approach to induce cooperative behaviour is to assign additional rewards based on other agents' well-being. However, this approach suffers from the issues of multi-agent credit assignment and non-stationarity. These issues are efficiently alleviated in cooperative setting with such algorithms as QMIX and COMA. As an extension of these algorithms for mixed environments, we propose BAROCCO. Our algorithm is compatible with both Q-learning and Actor-Critic frameworks and is capable to balance individual and social incentives.",reinforcementLearning,1b,https://storage.googleapis.com/eeml/695077538ec84a359a7401aa3eb9c60d,https://www.youtube.com/embed/R49-aIGukvA

2741,Learning robust visual representations using data augmentation invariance,"Alex Hernandez-Garcia, Peter König, Tim Kietzmann","The current most accurate models of image object categorization are deep neural networks trained on large labeled data sets. Minimizing a classification loss between the predictions of the network and the true labels has proven an effective way to learn discriminative functions of the object classes. However, recent studies have suggested that such models learn highly discriminative features that are not aligned with visual perception and might be at the root of adversarial vulnerability. Here, we propose to replace the classification loss with the joint optimization of invariance to identity-preserving transformations of images (data augmentation invariance), and the invariance to objects of the same category (class-wise invariance). We hypothesize that optimizing these invariance objectives might yield features more aligned with visual perception, more robust to adversarial perturbations, while still suitable for accurate object categorization.",deepLearning,1b,https://storage.googleapis.com/eeml/8d35375c28674adba518263c1d242a93,https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufM1HBJlmBY

Hebbian-type synaptic plasticity is believed to underlie the retention of memories over medium and long time scales in the brain. However, it is unclear how such plasticity processes are integrated with computations in cortical networks. Here, we propose Hebbian Memory Networks (H-Mems), a simple neural network model that is built around a core hetero-associative network subject to Hebbian plasticity. We show that the network can be optimized to utilize the Hebbian plasticity processes for its computations. H-Mems can one-shot memorize associations between stimulus pairs and use these associations for decisions later on. Furthermore, they can solve demanding question-answering tasks on synthetic stories. Our study shows that  neural network models are able to enrich their computations with memories through simple Hebbian plasticity processes.",neuroscience,2c,https://storage.googleapis.com/eeml/802c3fcc57ae4ff4958f57943e3da684,https://www.youtube.com/embed/G4UQCGfro0w

3645,A Generic and Model-Agnostic Exemplar Synthetization Framework for Explainable AI,"Antonio Barbalau, Adrian Cosma, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Marius Popescu","We have proposed a novel black-box exemplar synthetization framework which employs a generative model, acting as a prior for generating data, and traverses its latent space using a novel evolutionary strategy with momentum updates. Our framework is generic because it can employ any underlying generator and it can be applied to any input data. Additionally, since we use a zero-order optimization method, our framework is model-agnostic, in the sense that the machine learning model that we aim to explain is a black-box requiring no access or knowledge of the internal structure or the training data of the model.

As a result we get a model which scores documents in a list including context (aka other documents present in the list). We compare our method with common LTR approaches across different loss functions. The experiments show that proposed algorithm performs better than previously known methods.

We extend the reconstruction algorithm for cone-beam CT images by using the UNet architecture with 3D kernels. First, we find that using unfinished iterations as the input and finished iterations as target, the trained network can replace several consecutive iteration steps. Second, we show that the network can be used to remove sampling artifacts from reconstructions generated from subsampled projections. This way, using only 30% of the radiation dose would yield comparable image quality to the full-dose reconstructions.",mlMedicalData,3b,https://storage.googleapis.com/eeml/f469c4b2e06d499180c0f84a0396dcea,https://www.youtube.com/embed/PuXEHVBJIi0

So far we have tested 2 models: DCGAN and WGAN. Results from those models were not satisfactory yet and we are still developing new ideas on how to improve them.

Our method uses features learned by a Wavenet autoencoder, trained with a modified objective, employing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. We perform 
clustering on the latent representations and reconstrucction metrics of the heartbeat data, and use the learned clusters to predict the anomalies of new encoded signals.

The 3D motion generation task requires efficient regulation of stochasticity and a controlled approach for error-accumulation. Current generation approaches either fail to check error-amplitude or to preserve the signal. In this work, we discuss an approach to regulate the stochasticity for 3D human motion generation. This is achieved by designing a fully differentiable, block-based autoregressive RNN architecture by incorporating variable auto-conditioning length along with variational inference. The proposed approach provides a lesser joint prediction error with stable motion generation.",applications,3a,https://storage.googleapis.com/eeml/59a67f41a11c4671a04fae1aa2b68725,https://www.youtube.com/embed/SGXx57jKAQY

The emotions were represented according to Russell's model of affect, that maps them in valence-arousal space.
Using MFCCs features, the task was approached as regression and also as classification, illustrated on both Feed-Forward and Convolutional neural networks. 
Each method was further extended considering the output type. The problems are solved by model that outputs a point/quadrant in emotion-space and a group of two models each separately predicting or classifying valence and arousal or energy and intensity, respectively.",deepLearning,3b,https://storage.googleapis.com/eeml/2490cf8cb74b4e6cb3ae2844d27db80b,https://www.youtube.com/embed/2pxmr6NN2w8

As current approaches suffer from multiple drawbacks, it is tested whether deep reinforcement learning can be used to find a feasible and sensible buffer space distribution for production lines with random stops. The problem is formulated accordingly and a preliminary computational experiment is conducted using Q-learning, that shows promising first results.

The selection of an embryo suitable for transfer is currently carried out by visual assessment of time-lapse videos. This is subjective and can lead to different results between embryologists. Techniques from pattern recognition and machine learning may provide suitable tools to help support this task, leading to more reliable predictions. Here we use supervised learning methods to examine bright-field images of human embryos.

While various modality-specific approaches exist for different types of data, a core property of many methods is that representations of similar inputs are close under some similarity function. We propose EMDE (Efficient Manifold Density Estimator) – a framework utilizing arbitrary vector representations with the property of local similarity to succinctly represent smooth probability densities on Riemannian manifolds. Applying EMDE to both top-k and session-based recommendation settings, we establish new state-of-the-art results on multiple open datasets in both uni-modal and multi-modal settings.",Multimodal Learning,1a,https://storage.googleapis.com/eeml/f6cbc7d1374c43c49f79d4232b1f4a11,https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_5878IXPjE

We replicated this conclusion in a behavioral study. Moreover, we manipulated proposed rewards of the task in low and high parity conditions in order to check the normalization step of the algorithm. We did not find evidence contradicting that. Besides, we conducted the experiment in gain and loss domains to check the reward representation effect. We did not find evidence that choices were different in two domains. ",neuroscience,2c,https://storage.googleapis.com/eeml/6baf9f0677944fa98b3fb269d974d085,https://www.youtube.com/embed/3L-oxWzZaV0

We introduce a circular spring loss, which enforces minibatch points to be equally spaced and satisfy cyclic boundary conditions.

As an example of its application we propose multiple-path interpolations. Minimal distance geodesic between two points in uniform distribution on latent space of angles becomes a line, however, torus topology allows us to choose such lines in alternative ways, going through different edges of $[-\pi,\pi]^d$.

Therefore, it is hard to obtain theoretical results about its optimisation that are meaningful to practitioners without making strong assumptions. Although, it is not clear how such assumption should be made. We suggest to base them on properties of empirical risk observed in practice. Based on a literature study, we distinguish five such properties. We review a noisy quadratic model that assumes two of the highlighted properties.
