2,"Allegro","Diamond","Allegro is the #1 online shopping destination in Poland and the #6 eTail business in Europe. Started in 1999, today it is one of the most recognised brands in Poland. Allegro marketplace currently stands for 130 million offers listed each month, 140,000 merchants’ accounts (ranging from the world's biggest brands to small and medium enterprises), and over 21 million registered accounts. Making a site like this work requires a lot of engineering and as the site grows, we learn and adopt new technologies. What started out as a huge monolithic application, over the years migrated towards an ecosystem of loosely coupled microservices written in Java and other JVM languages running in the cloud. Creating a scalable and distributed system at this scale brings about many challenges which make our work interesting.","https://www.youtube.com/embed/A44ZgFhDBQY","/static/images/sponsors/AllegroTech.png"
