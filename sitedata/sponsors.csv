We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority. We have a track record of breakthroughs in fundamental AI research, published in journals like Nature, Science, and more. Our programs have learned to diagnose eye diseases as effectively as the world’s top doctors, to save 30% of the energy used to keep data centres cool, and to predict the complex 3D shapes of proteins - which could one day transform how drugs are invented.","https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fb-kDlCHPgs","/static/images/sponsors/Deepmind.png","","<a href='https://deepmind.com/careers' target='blank'>Careers at DeepMind</a>"
2,"Allegro","Diamond","Allegro is the most popular Polish shopping destination with about 17 million users monthly and over 1.1 million items sold on the platform daily. Making a site like this work requires a lot of engineering and as the site grows, we learn and adopt new technologies. What started out as a huge monolithic application is now migrating towards an ecosystem of loosely coupled microservices written in Java and other JVM languages running in the cloud. Creating a scalable and distributed system at this scale brings about many challenges which make our work interesting.

7,"Oveit","Gold","Our company provides edge payments technology. Our tech is based on locally distributed ledgers, embedded in IoT devices and secured with AI algo … well, you get the point – there’s a lot of cool tech under the hood. What it boils down to is that Oveit allows you to do payments even if the internet is down, with very high numbers of transactions. It can operate in harsh conditions and with very high numbers of visitors.

By the way – why edge? What does edge payments mean? Edge computing means data is being processed where it’s operated, at the edge of the cloud. Given that we focus on payments and we operate these through a buffer layer on location, we called the technology “edge payments”.

To achieve our goals we continually develop our fraud detection systems, biometric identifiers as well as recommender systems based on NLP in our streaming product. We are always on the lookout for talented members to join our offices in Bucharest, Romania or Austin, TX, USA.","https://player.vimeo.com/video/312000658","/static/images/sponsors/Oveit.png","zzz_sponsor_oveit","<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/oveit/' target='blank'>Oveit on Linkedin</a>|<a href='https://oveit.com/eaas/' target='blank'>Oveit Pay</a>|<a href='https://oveit.com/streams/' target='blank'>Streams</a>"
