1,"DeepMind","Diamond","Artificial intelligence could be one of humanity's most useful inventions. DeepMind aims to build advanced AI to expand our knowledge and find new answers. By solving this one thing, we believe we could help people solve thousands of problems. We’re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority. We have a track record of breakthroughs in fundamental AI research, published in journals like Nature, Science, and more. Our programs have learned to diagnose eye diseases as effectively as the world’s top doctors, to save 30% of the energy used to keep data centres cool, and to predict the complex 3D shapes of proteins - which could one day transform how drugs are invented.","no video","/static/images/sponsors/Deepmind.png"
2,"Allegro","Diamond","Allegro.pl is the largest Polish e-commerce marketplace, with over 20 million of unique users and selection of over 150 milion offers. With the scale come many challenges best solved by machine learning. In this talk I will give you a whirlwind tour of the lifecycle of products and customers on the platform and how at each step of the journey we use ML to improve the shopping experience. Starting from adding new offers to the platform and matching them with suitable products, through textual and visual search, recommending new products, and finally, to automating customer support, I will zoom in at each step of the customer's journey and explain ML models working tirelessly behind the scenes. Get ready to hear about metric learning for both text and vision, multi-modal ranking and recommendations, training BERT models on Allegro’s corpora and how real-life problems lead to both production models and research questions and papers coming out of Machine Learning Research group at Allegro.pl","https://www.youtube.com/embed/A44ZgFhDBQY","/static/images/sponsors/AllegroTech.png"

7,"Oveit","Gold","Our company provides edge payments technology. Our tech is based on locally distributed ledgers, embedded in IoT devices and secured with AI algo … well, you get the point – there’s a lot of cool tech under the hood. What it boils down to is that Oveit allows you to do payments even if the internet is down, with very high numbers of transactions. It can operate in harsh conditions and with very high numbers of visitors.

By the way – why edge? What does edge payments mean? Edge computing means data is being processed where it’s operated, at the edge of the cloud. Given that we focus on payments and we operate these through a buffer layer on location, we called the technology “edge payments”.

To achieve our goals we continually develop our fraud detection systems, biometric identifiers as well as recommender systems based on NLP in our streaming product. We are always on the lookout for talented members to join our offices in Bucharest, Romania or Austin, TX, USA.","https://player.vimeo.com/video/312000658","/static/images/sponsors/Oveit.png"
